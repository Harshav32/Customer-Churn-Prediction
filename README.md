# Customer-Churn-Prediction
Churn prediction is the process of identifying which consumers are most likely to
abandon a service or cancel their membership. For many firms, this is a crucial
assumption because getting new customers is generally more expensive than keeping
existing ones. You should know exactly what marketing activity to do for each
individual consumer once you've identified those who are on the verge of canceling.
This will increase the possibilities that the customer will stay with you.
Customers' behaviors and preferences vary; therefore they cancel their memberships for
a variety of reasons. It's vital, then, to connect with each of them on a regular basis in
order to keep them on your client list. You must know which marketing action is most
effective for each and every customer, as well as when it is most effective.
Customer churn is a problem that affects firms in a variety of industries. You must
invest in recruiting new clients if you want to expand as a business. Every time a client
departs, a large amount of money is lost. It is necessary to devote both time and effort to
their replacement. Knowing when a client is likely to depart and offering them
incentives to stay can save a company a lot of money. As a result, knowing what keeps
consumers engaged is incredibly useful information, as it may aid in the development of
retention strategies and the implementation of operational practices targeted at
preventing customers from leaving.
This project focuses on exploratory data analysis, which results in determining which
attributes from customer data have the greatest impact on customer churning, and
building a machine learning model that can predict which customers are most likely to
churn, which can then be used to take steps to keep the customer
